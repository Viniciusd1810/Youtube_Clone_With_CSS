# Youtube Clone With CSS
Reproduced the YouTube homepage and video page using HTML and CSS, focusing on adaptive layouts and design accuracy. I started using a figma model from 2022, but i add some atual 2025 youtube layout styles

The project was supposed to be only the video page, but i added the index page. 

## Project Demonstration
